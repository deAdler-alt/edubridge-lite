# EduBridge Lite - Pitch Report

## 1. Introduction
EduBridge Lite reduces barriers to learning by turning any lesson (text, photo, or link) into digestible Key Points, Easy Language, Flashcards and a Quiz, all running offline in a PWA.

## 2. Market Analysis
- Target users: high-schoolers and under-resourced learners; teachers preparing quick study aids.
- Pain points: limited data plans, patchy connectivity, long-form materials, time pressure.
- Existing tools often require logins, paid AI credits, or constant connectivity.

## 3. Impact Analysis
- Individual: more time-efficient revision, improved comprehension via Easy Language and audio (TTS).
- Classroom/Community: printable PDFs with QR back to app; shareable offline packs; no accounts.

## 4. Cost Structure (rough)
- Hosting: free tier Vercel (static + minimal serverless).
- OCR/TTS: fully client-side (no per-use cost).
- Development: open-source, volunteer-driven.

## 5. Implementation Plan
- MVP (done): PWA, OCR, Link Import, Key Points, Flashcards, Quiz, My Packs, TTS, PDF.
- Next: Telegram hardening, new importers (PDF/docx), UI polishing, community contributions.

## 6. Conclusion
EduBridge Lite demonstrates that accessible, offline-first study tools can be built with free technology, offering real impact without requiring paid AI APIs.
